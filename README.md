# Caesar-Cipher

A beginner level Python project which encodes and decodes a given string of message as per the Caesar Cipher technique.

It asks the user for the shift which needs to be carried out on the alphabets, leaving the numbers and the special character as it (un-encoded)

Also, ASCII art has been incorporated in the art.py, to give an introductory look when the program runs.
